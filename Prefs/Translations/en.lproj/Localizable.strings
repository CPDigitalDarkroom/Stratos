/*
 Thanks for helping translate Stratos! Translate the items that are not in all caps, for example, you would change:
 "HELLO_PHRASE" = "Hello";
 to:
 "HELLO_PHRASE" = "Hola";
 Try to follow the same scheme as me for capitalization.
 Happy translating! Thanks again,
    The Cortex Dev Team :)
 If you have any questions, or a setting needs more clarification/context for you to translate it well, feel free to shoot me an email at milodarling98@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can
